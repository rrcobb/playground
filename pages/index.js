    <p>Ignore most of the things here.</p>

      <h3>What's here</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Playing with nextjs pages to see how they work</li>
        <li>A dumb page that lists a bunch of umd courses</li>
        <li>A dumb email-sender for the word assassins game</li>
      </ul>
      The only thing you might actually want to do is play word assassins. It's
      a great game, and this app makes running it slightly easier.
